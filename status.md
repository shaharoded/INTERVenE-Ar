# EMR Event-Prediction Transformer — Patient-Level Eval Loop

## Inherited from prior session

Decisions carried forward from the architecture sweep + ablations. The
specific AUC numbers from that session were computed under the
**per-window** eval framing and **are not comparable** to the new
patient-level peak-detector headline — don't anchor to them.

- **Architecture**: M-256 — `embed_dim=256`, `n_layer=4`, `n_head=4`,
  `time2vec_dim=32`, `dropout=0.10`. Params ~6.4 M. Peak VRAM at training ~5 GB.
- **Optimiser**: AdamW. `phase{1,2}_lr=3e-4`, `phase3_lr=1e-4`,
  `phase3_backbone_lr_factor=0.01`. Aux caps `{ce: 0.5, dt: 0.5, ranking: 0.2}`.
- **Training**: three-phase. Phase 1 embedder; Phase 2 GPT pretrain with
  curriculum (BCE → CE + Δt → pairwise ranking); Phase 3 outcome-head fine-tune.
- **Evaluation seed**: 2-day input → 14-day generation horizon. (Prior
  k-day-seed scan ruled k=1 below operational floor; AUROC plateaued
  from k=2 onward; k=2 chosen for the operational use case.)
- **QA data**: `USE_QA_DATA=False`. The QA-augmented variant added new
  context features + tokens; in the prior eval framing it didn't move
  the headline. The new loop will revisit this in **P7** as the final
  step on the running-best model.
- **Running best on HEAD**: Z (direction E — narrow + frozen terminal
  `log_tau_lm`). No checkpoint on disk; pod is fresh and Phase 1
  retrains.

## Patient-level eval loop

Per `program.md`. New eval framing (per-patient peak detector). The
agent appends `### <tag>` blocks here as experiments run.

Each block records: tag, what changed (1–2 lines), smoke gate results,
post-train gate results, headline numbers (`patient_auroc_weighted`,
per-outcome AUROC for DEATH/RELEASE/each complication, peak-MAE),
trajectory honesty (`gen_to_gt_ratio_median`,
`gen_frac_terminal_first24h`), verdict (KEEP / DISCARD) with reason.

### B0-Z @ 10k (SHA 8d3cf18)

P0 baseline. Z (direction E — narrow + frozen terminal `log_tau_lm`,
init `log(12/336)`) on HEAD. No code change — first run on new
patient-level peak-detector eval.

Smoke (sample=50, phase{1,2,3}_n_epochs=1):
- Gate A pass — no NaN, train=8.5680, val=7.8539 at Phase-3 epoch 1.

### B0-C-ttt @ 10k (SHA ea65988)

P0 baseline #2. Cherry-pick of dd3fc1b "C-ttt-head" (time-to-terminal
regression aux) on top of B0-Z. Adds an MSE head predicting
`log1p(t_terminal − t_now)` at every non-terminal, non-pad position,
sharing the backbone. Joins Phase-2 stage 0 alongside ce/dt with
fraction_cap=0.30. Goal: force the backbone to encode distance-to-
terminal explicitly so the LM head can decide WHEN to emit terminal
tokens.

Smoke (sample=50, phase{1,2,3}_n_epochs=1):
- Gate A pass — no NaN; RawTrain ce=1.31, dt=0.81, ranking=0.69,
  ttt=19.19, all finite.
- Gate B pass — ttt within ~25× of ce/dt (within 1–2 OOM).
- Gate C pass — λ_ranking calibrated 2.497 ∈ [1e-3, 10].
- Gate D pass — summary block + all headline keys present.

Post-train (10k):
- T1 pass — Phase-3 raw_out 2.11→1.01, raw_rank 0.66→0.38; ttt λ_max
  calibrated at Phase-2 epoch 3 (λ_max=0.0040, raw_aux=20.86 — head
  starts well above ce/dt then decays).
- T2 pass — Phase-2 ranking calibrated epoch 31, ramp 31→35, full
  active by 35; Phase-2 early stop at epoch 40 (5 epochs of full
  stage-1 activity before stop). Phase-3 best val at epoch 15 (0.996),
  early stop at epoch 23.
- T3 pass — DEATH AUROC 0.710 (+0.017 vs B0-Z), KIDNEY 0.715,
  CARDIO 0.709, KETOACIDOSIS 0.915 (+0.124 — biggest single per-outcome
  swing).

- INFECTION                 0.551  (−0.015)

Peak MAE vs B0-Z (hours):
- DEATH:    168.97  (+10.13  — REGRESSION ≥ 5h threshold)
- RELEASE:   71.29  (−14.68 ✓)
- DISGLYCEMIA_Hyper:  36.07 (−7.91)
- KIDNEY:            79.11  (−27.25)
- CARDIO:            79.08  (−28.91)

Trajectory honesty:
- `gen_median_hours`:           75.05  (vs B0-Z 114.48 — generates shorter)
- `gen_to_gt_ratio_median`:      0.720  (vs B0-Z 1.116 — still ≥ 0.4 ✓)
- `gen_frac_terminal_first24h`:  0.165  (vs B0-Z 0.148 — slight bump)

Phase stats: phase2_best_val 0.187 / 41 epochs (early stopped);
phase3_best_val 1.144 / 23 epochs (early stopped). Both terminate
earlier than B0-Z (46/29) — Phase-3 best val is also lower (1.144 vs
1.157), so faster convergence on a better minimum.

Verdict: **BASELINE-KEEP, RUNNING BEST** — between the two P0
baselines, B0-C-ttt clearly wins on the primary headline
(`patient_auroc_weighted` 0.683 > 0.667) and lifts both DEATH and
RELEASE AUROC simultaneously, which is the precise pattern program.md
predicted under the new framing. The DEATH-MAE regression (+10 h) and
the NEUROVASCULAR / HYPEROSMOLALITY AUROC dips are real costs, but
n_pos is small (29, 83) so per-outcome variance is high, and the model
is generating 35 % shorter sequences (75 h vs 114 h) which mechanically
explains the slight DEATH-MAE drift toward the rare-DEATH median.
P0 KEEP rule (better of two baselines) applies — KEEP/DISCARD threshold
test is for subsequent experiments vs this running best.

Checkpoints backed up to `emr_model/checkpoints.bak_keep_B0-C-ttt/`.
This is the running best for P1 (MIL max-BCE).

### P1-MIL @ 10k (SHA 422dcbc) — DISCARD

P1 direction. Added a patient-level multiple-instance-learning aux to
Phase 3: soft-max-attention pool of outcome logits across time steps,
BCE against `patient_label = outcome occurs anywhere in GT`. Soft-max
temperature `mil_log_T` learnable per outcome. λ_mil calibrated once
at end of Phase-3 epoch 1, capped at fraction 0.20 of raw outcome BCE
(same regime as ranking). Per-position BCE kept as 48-h calibration
anchor.

Smoke (sample=50, phase{1,2,3}_n_epochs=1):
- Gates A–D all pass. raw_out=8.52, raw_rank=0.69, raw_mil=1.07
  (within 1× of BCE). λ_mil=1.585, λ_ranking=2.46, both ∈ [1e-3, 10].

Post-train (10k):
- T1 fail — Phase-3 raw_out drops from 2.053 to 1.174 between epoch 1
  and 2 (this is normal — calibration kick when λ_ranking goes 0→cal).
  raw_mil rises 3.685→4.635 over the 6 active epochs: the MIL aux is
  being optimised AGAINST, not toward. Aux gradient too weak to fight
  per-position BCE conflict.
- T2 fail — Phase-3 early stop fires at epoch 6, with best `vl_select`
  at epoch 1 (1.1125) — i.e., before λ_mil was even active.
  Subsequent epochs (with λ_mil=0.111) consistently increased vl_select.
- T3 fail — DEATH AUROC drops 0.710→0.665 (-0.045); the head no longer
  shows the discrimination the run was supposed to add.

Headline (Δ vs B0-C-ttt running best):
- `patient_auroc_weighted`: **0.6427** (−0.0404 — fails ≥+0.030 KEEP)
- `patient_auprc_weighted`: 0.5855 (−0.0481)
- `patient_auroc_simple`:   0.6112 (−0.0847)

Per-outcome AUROC Δ vs B0-C-ttt — universal regression except RELEASE:

Peak MAE (hours) Δ vs B0-C-ttt:
- DEATH:   172.74 (+3.77, marginal)
- RELEASE:  79.16 (+7.87)
- DISGLYCEMIA_Hyper:  32.59 (−3.47, small improvement)
- KIDNEY:             63.33 (−15.78)

Trajectory honesty:
- `gen_median_hours`:           91.22 (vs 75.05)
- `gen_to_gt_ratio_median`:      0.900 (≥ 0.4 ✓)
- `gen_frac_terminal_first24h`:  0.245 (vs 0.165 — terminal-first jumps)

Phase stats: phase2 ran all 50 epochs; phase3 early-stopped at 6 with
best at epoch 1.

Verdict: **DISCARD**. Falsifiable (patient AUROC ≥ +0.030) missed by
0.070. The MIL aux pulled Phase 3 away from the running best optimum
within 1 epoch of activation, and the model never recovered. The
likely mechanism: with patient_label being "outcome occurs anywhere",
the soft-max-pooled score is dominated by the position with the
highest logit, and BCE gradient on the pool propagates back to that
position. For a negative patient on a rare outcome, the path of least
resistance is to lower ALL logits — destroying per-position
discrimination that B0-C-ttt had carefully built. The per-position
BCE anchor was insufficient to hold ground (its λ=1.0 vs MIL's
effective contribution ~0.20 of BCE, but the gradient directions
conflict). The single positive class (RELEASE, 87 % prevalence)
benefits because the pool's collective lift is aligned with its
target.

This is a learning-recipe problem, not a code/architecture bug. The
direction is sound in principle, but the loss formulation as
specified is too coarse next to per-position BCE for rare outcomes.
P2's soft-argmax time loss is a positives-only loss — that constraint
may avoid this failure mode. Proceeding to P2.

Reverting code commit per loop step 9.

tokenizer + scaler from the train split, caches the processed dataset,
runs the three phases (training in one subprocess, eval in another),
and prints the summary block.
